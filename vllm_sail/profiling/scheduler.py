"""NVTX instrumentation for ``vllm/v1/core/sched/scheduler.py``.

Port of the fork's scheduler hunks (+34 lines) as delegating patches, per
``docs/developer_guide/architecture.md``:

* ``@annotate("schedule")`` on ``Scheduler.schedule`` — exact port.
* ``sche_mark(scheduler_output)`` — the fork called it inside
  ``_update_after_schedule`` *and* redundantly from engine core / model
  runner. ``schedule()`` calls ``_update_after_schedule`` on every path, so
  marking here covers all consumers with a single call site.

Unlike the fork, this preserves the 6-line upstream comment above the
routed-experts block-ID snapshot that the fork's NVTX commit accidentally
deleted (noted in §1.6), because no upstream body is copied.

Installed only by ``vllm_sail.profiling.install()`` when
``VLLM_SAIL_NVTX_PROFILE`` is set; never imported otherwise.
