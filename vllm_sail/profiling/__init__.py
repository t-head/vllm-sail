"""NVTX profiling instrumentation for PPU — strictly opt-in.

The in-tree PPU fork threads NVTX ranges through
``v1/worker/gpu_model_runner.py`` (+86 lines / 14 hunks),
``v1/engine/core.py`` (+59), ``v1/core/sched/scheduler.py`` (+34) and
``vllm/benchmarks/serve.py`` (+28). Phase-0 triage established that **all** of
those changes are instrumentation: not one line is needed for PPU to compute
correctly.

Keeping them in the always-on patch set would put three of the five largest-hunk
patches on the production path, for observability nobody uses in production. So
they live here instead and install **nothing** unless ``VLLM_SAIL_NVTX_PROFILE`` is
set and the optional dependencies import.

Consequences, all good:

* zero overhead and zero patch risk when profiling is off;
* the profiling patches may lag an upstream bump without blocking a release;
* a missing ``nvtx`` / ``model_prof`` degrades to a warning, not a crash.
