"""Out-of-tree registration into vLLM's documented extension points.

Everything here is a *call into an API upstream provides*, not a patch. That
distinction matters: a registration cannot drift when upstream refactors, so each
item that lives here instead of in ``patch/`` is permanently cheaper to maintain.

Four of the in-tree fork's file edits are eliminated outright by this package:

| Fork edit | Replaced by |
|---|---|
| ``kernels/linear/__init__.py`` (+45) | ``register_linear_kernel`` -> ``linear_kernels`` |
| ``kernels/linear/scaled_mm/__init__.py`` (+10) | same |
| ``quantization/__init__.py`` (+4) | ``register_quantization_config`` -> ``quant_config`` |
| ``fused_moe/__init__.py`` (+14, re-exports only) | nothing needed; the plugin owns the classes |

``moe_backends/`` is the exception: upstream has no ``register_moe_backend``, so
those carry real patches. They are the top candidate for an upstream contribution.

Call :func:`register` to perform every registration. Importing this package has
no side effects, so dependency-free helpers below it remain importable on bare
CPU test runners; :func:`register` is idempotent.

Registration mutates vLLM-owned global registries. A partial failure therefore
cannot be rolled back safely; subsequent calls fail with a restart-required
error instead of pretending that retrying in the same process is transactional.
