"""PPU change to ``vllm.model_executor.models.qwen3_next``.

Ports the fork's +19 hunk: module-level NVTX range push/pop helpers used for
model profiling. The fork resolves them at import time from
``envs.VLLM_PPU_NVTX_PROFILE``; here they resolve lazily on first use (patch
modules must not do work at import time) with identical observable
behaviour: no-op unless ``VLLM_PPU_NVTX_PROFILE`` is set and
``torch.cuda.nvtx`` imports.

Both helpers are installed additively (``allow_missing``): upstream has no
such attributes. They are defined but currently uncalled in the fork file
itself — the call sites live behind the Phase-6 profiling work — so the
remove condition names that hand-off explicitly.
