"""Add ``Platform.is_ppu()`` to vLLM.

This is the keystone patch of the whole plugin. The in-tree PPU fork added a
``PlatformEnum.PPU`` member and an ``is_ppu()`` predicate to
``vllm/platforms/interface.py``; a plugin cannot add an enum member, but it can
add the predicate.

Adding it — rather than requiring PPU code to ask something else — means all 101
``current_platform.is_ppu()`` call sites in the fork port over verbatim, and
non-PPU platforms keep answering ``False``.

``PPUPlatform`` declares ``_enum = PlatformEnum.CUDA`` (see
``vllm_sail/platform.py``), so PPU cannot be identified from ``_enum``. The
discriminator is ``device_name == "ppu"``, which ``PPUPlatform`` sets as a class
attribute and no other platform uses.
