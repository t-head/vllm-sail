"""Drop ``enable_shrink`` from the DeepEP low-latency all2all buffer kwargs.

The fork comments out ``enable_shrink=self.support_fault_tolerance`` in
``DeepEPLLAll2AllManager._make_all2all_kwargs``
(``vllm/distributed/device_communicators/all2all.py``) with a FIXME: the PPU
``deep_ep`` build does not support ``enable_shrink`` yet, so passing it breaks
low-latency buffer creation on PPU.

Delegating patch: upstream still builds the whole kwargs dict; we only remove
the one key, and only on PPU.
