"""Raise the allocator ``max_split_size_mb`` floor for PPU during model load.

Upstream ``Worker.load_model`` scopes
``self._scoped_allocator_max_split(max_split_size_mb=20)`` — 20 MiB is the
minimum stock PyTorch allows. The fork computes ``32`` instead when
``current_platform.is_ppu()`` because PPU's torch raises the CachingAllocator
minimum for ``max_split_size_mb`` from 20 to 32; passing 20 errors out during
weight loading.

Delegating patch on the context-manager helper rather than a copy of
``load_model``: bumping the value at this single seam covers every caller and
survives upstream edits to ``load_model``'s surrounding context stack.
