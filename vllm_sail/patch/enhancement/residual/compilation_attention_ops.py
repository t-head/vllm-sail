"""Register the PPU sparse-attention indexer op as a piecewise split point.

The fork adds ``"vllm::ppu_sparse_attn_indexer"`` (+1 line) to
``CompilationConfig._attention_ops`` in ``vllm/config/compilation.py`` — the
class-level list of attention ops that ``set_splitting_ops_for_v1`` copies into
``splitting_ops`` for piecewise cudagraphs. Without it, the PPU indexer op
(registered by ``vllm_sail.ops`` and dispatched from the patched
``SparseAttentionIndexer.forward_ppu``) is not treated as an attention
boundary, unlike its upstream sibling ``vllm::sparse_attn_indexer``.

This is distinct from ``PPUPlatform.apply_config_platform_defaults`` appending
``+sparse_attn_indexer`` to ``custom_ops``: that enables the CustomOp dispatch,
while ``_attention_ops`` controls compilation graph splitting.

Delegating patch: the PPU op is appended to the class-level list (idempotently)
just before upstream's method copies it into ``splitting_ops``. No upstream body
is copied.
