"""Route ``CustomOp`` dispatch to ``forward_ppu`` when an op provides one.

Upstream ``CustomOp.dispatch_forward`` ends in a platform ladder that falls
through to ``forward_cuda``. PPU declares ``PlatformEnum.CUDA``, so it already
lands on ``forward_cuda`` — which is the right default and exactly what
``forward_ppu`` does in the in-tree fork.

What is missing is the ability for an individual op to *override* the CUDA
implementation on PPU. Five ops in the fork do:
``model_executor/layers/mhc.py`` (4 ops) and
``model_executor/layers/sparse_attn_indexer.py`` (1 op).

**Why a wrapper instead of a body copy.** The fork inserts an
``elif current_platform.is_ppu(): return self.forward_ppu`` branch into
``dispatch_forward``, which means carrying a verbatim copy of a ~35-line upstream
method that also handles ``_enforce_enable``, the enabled/disabled custom-op
bookkeeping and ``maybe_compile``. Copying it would silently diverge whenever
upstream touches any of that. Instead we delegate to the original and only
redirect the one case we care about: upstream chose ``forward_cuda`` *and* this
op class actually overrides ``forward_ppu``. Upstream can add platforms, change
the enable logic, or reorder the ladder without breaking us.
