"""PPU compatibility patches.

These are not bug fixes and not optimisations — they are the small set of
additions that let a CUDA-compatible plugin reuse upstream vLLM's CUDA code
paths. Removing any of them breaks PPU.

Import order is significant for `platform_predicates` (must come first: every
other patch may call `current_platform.is_ppu()`) and for `attention` (must
come after `custom_op_dispatch`, which installs the `forward_ppu` dispatch
reroute that the attention `forward_ppu` additions rely on).
