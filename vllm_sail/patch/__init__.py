"""PPU runtime patches for vLLM.

Call :func:`install` to apply every patch. Importing this package has **no side
effects** — that is deliberate and differs from vLLM-MetaX, whose patch package
installs on import.

Why explicit installation matters:

* ``from vllm_sail.patch.utils import patch`` is what every patch module does. If
  importing the package installed the patches, that line would trigger a partial
  circular import of the package from inside its own initialisation.
* It keeps ``vllm_sail.patch.utils`` importable without vLLM installed, so the
  patch framework itself is unit-testable on a bare CPU runner.
* Installation order and failure handling become visible and testable instead of
  being an emergent property of import order.

Load order is ``bugfix`` -> ``enhancement`` -> ``performance``:

* ``bugfix/`` — defects in upstream vLLM that break PPU. Should disappear as
  upstream fixes land.
* ``enhancement/`` — PPU compatibility shims. The Phase-2 patches live here; they
  are what let PPU reuse upstream's CUDA paths.
* ``performance/`` — replacements that are functionally equivalent but faster on
  PPU. Safe to disable when debugging.

Note the relative imports below. vLLM-MetaX's equivalent module ships
``from utils import patch`` — an *absolute* import that raises
``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'utils'`` on a clean interpreter and stops
its patches installing at all.
