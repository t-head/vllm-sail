"""PPU SAIL CUDA PLA kernel integration for GDN prefill.

Prefill counterpart of :mod:`sail_cuda_pla` (which routes GDN *decode* to the
PPU SAIL CUDA ``k_last`` / ``k_last_packed`` kernels). When enabled, the GDN
prefill computation is routed from the community Triton/FLA chunk kernels to
the FlashQLA CUDA kernel provided by the external ``pla`` package:

* ``pla.prefill.flashqla.chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd``

The routing is controlled by the ``VLLM_SAIL_USE_PLA`` environment variable
(default: on) -- the same switch that gates the decode PLA kernels -- and is
only effective when all of the following hold:

* running on the PPU platform (``current_platform.is_ppu()``);
* the ``pla`` package is importable;
* the per-model constraints of the FlashQLA kernel are satisfied (checked by
  the caller): head dims K == V == 128, and the TP-sharded
  ``(num_v_heads, num_k_heads)`` pair present in ``SUPPORTED_HEAD_CONFIGS``.

Unlike the decode resolver, a missing ``pla`` package is *not* an error here:
prefill has a fully functional Triton/FLA fallback, so the resolver logs a
warning and leaves the kernel handle unset rather than breaking deployments
that do not ship ``pla``.

Note the state-layout difference the caller must bridge: vLLM/FLA store the
ssm state as ``[N, H, DV, DK]`` while FlashQLA takes ``initial_state`` as
``[batch, H, DK, DV]`` fp32 and returns the final state in the same layout.
