"""PPU SAIL CUDA PLA kernel integration for GDN decode.

Mirrors SGLang's ``SGLANG_SAIL_PLA_CUDA`` mechanism (sglang commit
b7d85d39bd9e3a4165c068a15314629647e8b393, "feat(pla): support ppu cuda pla
kernel"): when enabled, the GDN decode PLA computations are routed from the
community Triton kernels to the PPU SAIL CUDA kernels provided by the
external ``pla`` package (Fused Sigmoid Gating Delta Rule CUDA kernels):

* ``fused_sigmoid_gating_delta_rule_forward_k_last``
* ``fused_sigmoid_gating_delta_rule_forward_k_last_packed``

The routing is controlled by the ``VLLM_SAIL_USE_PLA`` environment variable
(default: on) and is only effective when all of the
following hold:

* running on the PPU platform (``current_platform.is_ppu()``);
* the ``pla`` package is importable;
* the per-call tensor constraints of the CUDA kernels are satisfied
  (checked at the call sites): float32 ssm state pool, int32 state
  indices, head dims K == V == 128, and -- because vLLM reserves slot 0
  as NULL_BLOCK_ID (unlike sglang's PAD_SLOT_ID = -1) -- every call passes
  ``is_sglang=False``.

If ``VLLM_SAIL_USE_PLA`` is enabled (the default) but the ``pla`` package
cannot be imported on the PPU platform, an ``ImportError`` is raised so
that the caller can decide how to handle the missing dependency (e.g.
fall back to Triton, or surface the error to the user).
