## Overview

vLLM SAIL is a hardware plugin for [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm).
It connects vLLM's inference engine to the SAIL software stack, bringing PPU
kernels, attention backends, quantization and model integration to the standard
vLLM Python API and OpenAI-compatible server.

**SAIL** is the software stack and **PPU** is the hardware platform. The PPU
card family includes **ZW-810**, **ZW-810E**, and **ZW-890**. The Python
distribution is `vllm-sail`, the import package is `vllm_sail`, and the vLLM
plugin name is `ppu`.

The plugin builds native kernels with **HGGC**, using the `hgcc` compiler and
[cmake-hgcc](https://github.com/t-head/cmake-hgcc). PPU libraries and
[Triton for SAIL](https://github.com/t-head/triton-for-sail) provide specialized
compute paths. vLLM discovers the installed plugin through its platform and
general plugin entry points.

## Features

- **Native PPU kernels:** activation, normalization, quantization, cache
  operations, sampling and MoE routing compiled with HGGC.
- **Attention:** PPU FlashAttention integration, MLA and sparse attention,
  plus GDN and KDA linear attention paths.
- **Dense and MoE compute:** DeepGEMM, ACEXT and Triton backends, with BF16/FP16
  and selected INT8, FP8, MXFP4 and INT4 quantization paths.
- **Model integration:** PPU model registrations and adaptations for dense,
  mixture-of-experts and hybrid architectures.
- **Developer tooling:** tests that run without a PPU, reproducible kernel
  generation for upstream sources, patch checks and device correctness tests.

Availability depends on the device, SDK, backend and checkpoint format. See the
[feature matrix](docs/user_guide/supported_features.md) for implementation scope
and constraints, and the [verification guide](docs/user_guide/verification_guide.md)
for validating a deployment.

## Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Hardware | PPU cards ZW-810, ZW-810E and ZW-890; build targets `ppu_10` and `ppu_15` |
| Operating system | Linux for PPU builds and inference |
| Python | 3.10–3.13; choose a version supported by your SDK packages |
| vLLM | `>=0.30.0,<0.31.0`, built with `VLLM_TARGET_DEVICE=empty` |
| SAIL software | SAIL SDK, SAIL PyTorch and matching PPU compute libraries |
| Build tools | `hgcc`, CMake, Ninja and a C++ compiler; CMake fetches pinned cmake-hgcc sources when needed |

The generated upstream kernel sources are pinned to **vLLM v0.30.0**. The
[installation guide](docs/getting_started/installation.md) describes dependency
setup and native extension checks.

## Getting Started

Prepare the [SAIL environment](docs/getting_started/installation.md), then clone
and install the plugin:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/t-head/vllm-sail.git
cd vllm-sail
python -m pip install -r requirements/build.txt -r requirements/ppu.txt
python -m pip install --no-build-isolation --no-deps -e .
python -c "from vllm_sail import collect_env; collect_env()"
```

After the installation checks pass, start a server with a local model:

```bash
vllm serve /path/to/model \
  --served-model-name ppu-model \
  --dtype bfloat16 \
  --max-model-len 4096 \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Follow the [quickstart](docs/getting_started/quickstart.md) for a client request,
offline inference and model configuration.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome: report a reproducible issue, improve documentation,
add a test, tune a PPU workload or implement a kernel. Many development tasks
can be done without PPU hardware.
