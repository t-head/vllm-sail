"""Lightly-adapted upstream vLLM tests (CI category 5, ``mode = "adapted"``).

An ``adapted`` entry reuses an upstream test file whose *skeleton and
assertions* are valid for vllm-sail, but which mixes CPU-runnable logic with
device / distributed / network nodes, or carries a handful of known-failing
cases. The adaptation is data-driven and **never edits upstream source**:

* node narrowing (``markers`` / ``keywords`` / ``deselect``) and ``env``
  overrides are declared in ``REUSE_MANIFEST.toml`` and translated into pytest
  argv / environment by :class:`~tests.upstream_reuse._reuse_harness.UpstreamRunner`;
* expected failures (``xfail``) are reconciled here: a declared-xfail node that
  fails is tolerated, any *other* failure is a real regression;
* ``skip_reason`` parks an entry whose upstream prerequisites are not yet met
  (e.g. a warm offline tokenizer cache) without deleting it, keeping the intent
  auditable.

All of that reconciliation logic lives in this module, so following an upstream
bump only the manifest data changes -- never the upstream files.
