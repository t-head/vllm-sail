"""Directly-reused upstream vLLM tests (CI category 5, ``mode = "direct"``).

Two layers live here:

1. **CPU-only structural checks** over ``REUSE_MANIFEST.toml`` that run
   everywhere -- no upstream checkout, no torch, no vLLM. They guarantee the
   whitelist stays well-formed (unique ids, valid modes/chips, sane paths) so a
   malformed manifest fails fast even on a bare PR runner.

2. **Parameterized execution** of every ``direct`` entry: each upstream test
   file is run verbatim, as an isolated pytest subprocess rooted at the pinned
   checkout, inside the ambient vllm-sail runtime. "Direct" means zero edits and
   zero expected failures -- the file must come up green (all-pass or
   all-skipped-by-upstream), otherwise a genuine regression is reported.

Without ``VLLM_SOURCE_ROOT`` the directory conftest skips every item; with a
checkout but no installed vLLM/torch the ``upstream_runner`` fixture skips. So a
bare host yields "all skipped, 0 errors" while CI (which installs the runtime)
actually executes the whitelist.
