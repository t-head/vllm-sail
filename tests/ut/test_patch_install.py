"""Tests for patch installation as a whole.

The most important test here is :func:`test_patches_actually_land`. vLLM-MetaX
ships a patch package whose ``__init__`` does ``from utils import patch`` — an
absolute import that raises ``ModuleNotFoundError`` on a clean interpreter, so
none of its patches install. That failure is invisible unless something asserts
the patches took effect. This module is that assertion for us.
