# Installation

vLLM SAIL runs on Linux hosts with a PPU accelerator and a compatible SAIL SDK.
For documentation and unit-test development on a machine without PPU hardware,
follow [Contributing](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#development-environment).

## 1. Prepare the SAIL software stack

Use an SDK environment with the following components installed together:

| Component | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| SAIL SDK | Driver, HGGC headers, runtime libraries and `hgcc` compiler |
| SAIL PyTorch | A PPU build with `.ppu_compat/compatible_wrapper.h` |
| Triton | The [Triton for SAIL](https://github.com/t-head/triton-for-sail) build matching your SDK |
| Compute libraries | PPU builds of `acext`, `deep_gemm`, `flash_attn` and `flash_attn_3`, as needed by the selected backend |
| Model-specific libraries | PPU FlashMLA, PLA, TileLang or DeepEP when required by the workload |
| Python | 3.10–3.13, with matching SDK wheels |

Obtain the SDK and its Python packages through your PPU software distribution.
Use a matched set of libraries for the active SAIL PyTorch build. The plugin's
Python requirements do not install the SDK.

Activate that environment, then set paths for your installation:

```bash
export PPU_SDK=/path/to/ppu-sdk
export HGCC="$PPU_SDK/bin/hgcc"
export PYTORCH_SAIL_ARCH='ppu_15;ppu_10'
unset VLLM_SAIL_HG_ARCH
unset VLLM_SAIL_SKIP_EXT
```

CMake first uses an explicit `CMAKE_HGCC_DIR`, configured module path or
installed package. When none is available, it downloads the pinned
[cmake-hgcc](https://github.com/t-head/cmake-hgcc) revision and reuses it from
the build directory. For an offline build or a local mirror, set
`CMAKE_HGCC_DIR` to an existing checkout. Ensure the SDK runtime libraries are
on the system loader's search path, following your SDK's environment setup.

`PYTORCH_SAIL_ARCH` selects the device images included in the build. Use
`ppu_10`, `ppu_15`, or the quoted list above. The default includes both targets;
quoting prevents the shell from interpreting the semicolon as a command boundary.

## 2. Install matching vLLM

Install a vLLM build with `VLLM_TARGET_DEVICE=empty` in the same environment.
This lets the PPU plugin provide the native operations used by the engine.
The plugin accepts `>=0.30.0,<0.31.0`; its generated upstream kernel sources use
**v0.30.0** as the reproducible source baseline.

Use a matching wheel supplied with your PPU environment, or build that upstream
release from source. For a source build, first prepare vLLM's build and runtime
dependencies using the SDK's package constraints. Then run from the vLLM checkout:

```bash
python use_existing_torch.py
VLLM_TARGET_DEVICE=empty python -m pip install --no-build-isolation --no-deps .
```

The upstream helper removes dependency pins that would replace the active torch
installation. `--no-deps` assumes the runtime dependencies are already installed.
Keep the actual vLLM revision with your environment records.

## 3. Build and install the plugin

Clone the repository, then install its build dependencies in the same environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/t-head/vllm-sail.git
cd vllm-sail
python -m pip install -r requirements/build.txt -r requirements/ppu.txt
```

Check that the build will include native extensions:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
from vllm_sail.native.toolchain import decide, probe

decision = decide(probe())
print(decision.reason)
if not decision.build:
    raise SystemExit(1)
PY
```

Resolve any prerequisite reported by the check before continuing:

```bash
python -m pip install --no-build-isolation --no-deps -e .
```

Build isolation is disabled so the build can use the active SAIL PyTorch and
SDK. Native builds compile the authored plugin HGGC sources and committed
upstream corpus; installation requires neither sailify nor an upstream source
checkout.

For a distributable wheel and build controls, see [HGGC kernels](../developer_guide/kernels.md).

## 4. Check the installation

```bash
python -c "from vllm_sail import collect_env; collect_env()"
python - <<'PY'
import importlib
import torch
import vllm_sail
from vllm_sail.native.extensions import import_kernels

print('Plugin:', vllm_sail.__file__)
for name in ('_upstream_C', '_upstream_moe_C', '_C', '_moe_C'):
    extension = importlib.import_module(f'vllm_sail.{name}')
    print(name, extension.__file__)
print('Native preflight:', import_kernels(strict=True))
PY
```

The four libraries must load from the intended installation. Strict preflight
also checks representative operation registrations. These checks do not execute
a model; continue with the [quickstart](quickstart.md) and
[device verification](../user_guide/verification_guide.md).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Next step |
| --- | --- |
| Build fails before CMake configuration | Check SAIL PyTorch, its compatibility header, `hgcc` and CMake. Native extensions are required by default. |
| Build unexpectedly produces a `py3-none-any` wheel | Unset `VLLM_SAIL_SKIP_EXT`; it is the only Python-only build path. |
| CMake cannot fetch the HG language modules | Restore network access or set `CMAKE_HGCC_DIR` to an existing cmake-hgcc checkout. |
| Architectures disagree | Set `PYTORCH_SAIL_ARCH`; unset `VLLM_SAIL_HG_ARCH` or make both settings use the same targets. |
| A shared library reports an undefined symbol | Match the SDK library to the active SAIL PyTorch and runtime, then restart the process. |
| Native extensions are missing after installing a wheel | Check `vllm_sail.__file__`. A checkout can shadow the installed package; use an editable native build there or run outside it. |
| Plugin is not selected | If `VLLM_PLUGINS` is set, include `ppu`; see [Configuration](../user_guide/configuration.md). |
| vLLM version is rejected | Use the supported release range. For a development build with ambiguous metadata, see [Configuration](../user_guide/configuration.md#version-metadata). |
