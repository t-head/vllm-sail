# Supported Features

This page describes implemented PPU integration paths and their constraints.
An implementation entry is not a qualification of every device, SDK version or
checkpoint. Use the [verification guide](verification_guide.md) to establish
support for a specific deployment.

## Platform and compatibility

| Component | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Hardware | PPU cards ZW-810, ZW-810E and ZW-890 |
| Native targets | PPU 1.0 (`ppu_10`) and PPU 1.5 (`ppu_15`) |
| Bundled tuning data | Configurations include `PPU-ZW810`, `PPU-ZW810E` and `ZW-M890P`; coverage varies by shape and backend |
| vLLM | `>=0.30.0,<0.31.0`; generated native sources pinned to v0.30.0 |
| Python | 3.10–3.13 for the plugin and CPU test matrix; SDK wheel availability determines runtime combinations |

A tuned configuration describes a measured kernel shape. It does not establish
full-model compatibility. A missing configuration may use backend defaults and
need workload-specific tuning.

## Compute and attention

| Area | Implementation | Requirements and limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dense linear layers | PPU DeepGEMM, ACEXT and Triton paths | Selection depends on precision, tensor layout, device and installed libraries |
| Mixture of experts | PPU backends for unquantized and selected quantized experts | Backend support varies with expert shape and quantization format |
| FlashAttention | PPU FlashAttention 2 and 3 integration | Matching SDK libraries; version selection follows availability and model constraints |
| MLA and sparse attention | PPU FlashMLA integration and sparse indexer | Matching PPU libraries; FP8 dense FlashMLA decode is unavailable |
| Gated delta networks | PLA and Triton paths for GDN | PLA availability and supported shapes determine dispatch |
| Kimi delta attention | PLA and Triton paths for KDA | Backend and sequence-shape constraints apply |
| Native operations | HGGC activation, normalization, quantization, routing, cache, sampling and model-specific kernels | Only the selected source corpus is compiled; each changed kernel needs device correctness tests |
| Distributed MoE | DeepEP integration, including low-latency receive handling | Compatible PPU communication libraries and a validated multi-device setup |

## Precision and quantization

| Format | Implemented scope | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BF16 / FP16 | Dense, attention and unquantized MoE paths | Individual backends may accept only a subset; BF16 dense DeepGEMM is opt-in on PPU 1.5 |
| INT8 | Quantized dense and MoE compute | Scaling mode and weight layout must match the selected backend |
| FP8 | Dense, MoE and selected cache paths | Device-specific representation and scaling requirements; not every attention path accepts FP8 |
| MXFP4 | PPU DeepGEMM dense and MoE paths | Requires the matching library and checkpoint layout |
| INT4 W4A16 | Selected mixed-precision MoE paths | The compressed-tensors path accepts symmetric group-size-32 weights without zero points, expert bias or activation ordering |

Checkpoint format support is specific to the implementation. Weight repacking
alone does not establish execution support. Native Marlin execution remains
unavailable; do not infer general GPTQ or AWQ coverage from packing utilities.

## Model integration

| Model family or path | PPU integration |
| --- | --- |
| Dense and MoE models | Upstream vLLM architectures using the applicable PPU operators and backends |
| DeepSeek V4 | Model, MTP and DSpark registrations, with PPU attention, routing and cache paths |
| MiniMax M3 | Optional model registrations, quantization mapping and native attention-related operations |
| Qwen hybrid models | GDN attention and selected quantization and speculative-decoding adaptations |
| Kimi K3 | KDA attention and native MLA/cache operations |
| Mamba / Jamba | HGGC selective-scan source integration |

Model registration and kernel availability are separate checks. Record the exact
checkpoint revision, quantization, context length, parallelism and SDK when
reporting a successful model run. Newly compiled model-specific operations need
numerical and model-level validation on each target device.

## Selecting a backend

See [Configuration](configuration.md) for runtime choices and defaults. Build
coverage is defined by the [native source manifests](../developer_guide/kernels.md#source-ownership);
an excluded operation fails with a capability diagnostic rather than being
enabled by an environment variable.
