# Contributing to vLLM SAIL

Contributions to documentation, tests, PPU kernels and performance are welcome.
Check existing issues and pull requests before starting. Discuss substantial
API, dependency or architecture changes in an issue first.

## Development environment

The CPU test suite runs with Python 3.10–3.13 and does not require torch, vLLM,
the SAIL SDK or a device. From a checkout of this repository:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv-test
source .venv-test/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
python -m pytest tests/ut -q
```

The package is imported directly from the checkout for these tests. The expected
`vllm_sail._version is missing` warning can appear before the package is installed.
Optional integration tests skip when their dependencies are unavailable.

For native compilation or device testing, use the separate
[PPU installation instructions](docs/getting_started/installation.md).

## Coding guidelines

- Keep changes focused and describe the behavior they change.
- Prefer explicit interfaces and shared helpers when they remove real duplication.
- Preserve lazy imports and entry-point idempotency. Core imports and CPU tests
  must remain independent of optional SDK packages.
- Use the existing registration APIs and platform hooks before adding a patch.
  Read the [runtime patch guide](vllm_sail/patch/README.md) for metadata and copied
  source rules.
- Edit plugin-owned HGGC kernels directly in `csrc/plugin/`. For upstream
  kernels, edit generation inputs and regenerate; follow
  [HGGC kernel development](docs/developer_guide/kernels.md).
- Preserve upstream attribution and license headers. New Python files should
  use `# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`.
- Keep user documentation focused on reproducible PPU workflows. Personal
  run logs, implementation phase records and private environment notes belong
  outside the repository.

See [Architecture](docs/developer_guide/architecture.md) for module boundaries.

## Checks before review

Run the CPU tests and formatting checks:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ut -q
pre-commit run --files path/to/changed_file.py
```

For staged files or a full repository check:

```bash
pre-commit run
pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage manual
```

Add tests for behavior changes and keep formatting changes focused. For native
or runtime changes, follow [Verification](docs/user_guide/verification_guide.md)
and report any checks that were not run. Verify links and commands in docs.

## Pull request workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch for the change.
2. Implement the change and update the relevant tests and documentation.
3. Run the applicable checks and inspect the diff.
4. Push the topic branch to your fork and open a pull request.
5. Address review feedback; merge through the platform after review.

Use vLLM-style PR titles: `[Type][Scope] Concise behavior-oriented summary`,
with an optional scope. For example, `[Bugfix][MoE] Honor explicit backend
selection` or `[Doc] Clarify native build prerequisites`.

Complete the [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md), link related issues
and include test commands and results. Performance changes need baseline and
candidate measurements under the same workload. Avoid force pushes and direct
pushes to shared branches; use follow-up commits for review changes.

## Reporting issues

Use the bug or feature request template in the repository's Issues tab. Bug
reports should include a minimal reproducer, expected and actual results, the
full relevant error and `collect_env` output. Remove credentials, private host
addresses and confidential model paths from logs before posting.

Keep discussions respectful and focused on the work. Explain technical
disagreements with examples, measurements or source evidence.
